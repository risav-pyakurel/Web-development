    <h2> ID selector</h2>
    <p>
        CSS id selectors select any element in an HTML page, if it has an attribute called id, whose value matches the name of the id selector.

In a stylesheet document, the name of the id selector is preceded by a "#".

If an id selector is combined with another or more selectors, id selectors must be preceded with a #.

IDs can only be applied once in an HTML page
