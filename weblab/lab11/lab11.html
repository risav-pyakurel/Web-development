        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm a passionate and driven 3rd-year Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT) student at Tribhuvan University.
          Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of web development, 
          honing my skills in Django to create dynamic and user-friendly websites.
           <br> However, my curiosity extends beyond web development. 
           <br>  I have a profound interest in the fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
